AI REAL-TIME FACE DETECTION APP USING PYTHON AND importing OpenCV\
A real-time face detection app using python as the programming language with importing opencv library.\
In it we can take realtime clicks by using web-cam or also by giving command to take an image running from our files.\
Added a waitkey so that the regular intervals of webcam clicks can be controlled.
took loops so that multiple faces can be detected at a single time when using webcam or uploading an image from the local machine inside the code.

Learning from this:

Haar features and algorithms

1.how the haar cascade algorithm works in real-time upon grayscaled images

2.why it works better on grayscaled images than taking colored frames instead.

3.simple lines of code can do magic just putting the right things at right places

The result from this:

1.we can detect faces using either from our gallery and importing them or we can use webcam support to get the real time frame.

2.we can also detect real-time video faces from its frontal face if being classified into

3.multiple real-time faces can be detected and also with regular changing of dimensions

Challenges faced

1.the most important challenge is to train the data and it's time-consuming so to build a simple prototype taking OpenCV trained data is beneficial as it saves lots of time.

2.haar algorithm how it works is again one of the most important challenges as it has to be quite accurate to detect the face in real-time

3.importing OpenCV required installation of multiple packages and different versions of python have different versions of that library.
